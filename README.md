# What is SQL?

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

- I am posting stuff of SQL considering mysql database.

- There are many other databases like oracle, postgresql etc.

- But, Mysql is the most famous database and easy to learn, so, I am considering that.

- Most of the syntax are same, there is very small difference of syntax in other databases. But, logic or approach is always same in everything.

- So, learn without any problem.
