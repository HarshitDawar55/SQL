1)  "char" data type is used to store string.

2) It has fixed length.

3) If we provide data less than the specified length, even then it will add spaces to the right of the data to make it of complete length.

4) For example,

char(5) will allocate 5 bytes memory, and will always use 5 bytes to store data. 

5) It is faster than "varchar" data type.

6) Use it only when you are sure that the fixed length data will be entered.

7) Otherwise, use Varchar dataType.
