1)  "varchar" data type is used to store string.

2) It has variable length.

3) If we provide data less than the specified length, it will use memory space corresponding to the length of the data.

4) For example,

varchar(5) will not always allocate 5 bytes memory, it allocates memory based on the data size.

5) But, data greator than the specified length will be entered only till the point where the allocated memory space allows.

For Example, if we declare varchar(10) and enter a string of 15 characters, then 10 characters of the string will be entered and rest will be trimmed off.

6) Use it only whenever you want.

7) Slower than char data-type.
